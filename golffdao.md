## Golff DAO Governance Framework

### What is a DAO?

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) A decentralized autonomous organization, sometimes called a distributed autonomous corporation (DAC, decentralized autonomous corporation), is an organization represented by rules encoded in a computer program that Everyone in a DAO can issue proposals and vote to make decisions.

### Golff DAO Governance Framework

Golff DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization and smart contract system serving the Golff ecosystem, which refers to an open decentralized organization that is not controlled by hierarchical central authority, operates automatically according to predetermined program rules, and gives voice to all stakeholders in the network.GOF is the utility token and GDAO is the governance token of the Golff system.DAO members can initiate Golff project governance proposal, and through GDAO voting jointly decide project product development, operation direction, project cooperation, machine gun pool strategy, as well as the release rules and usage of the 3.86 million GOFs yet to be released.

### Golff DAO’s Organizational Structure

Golff DAO does not have a central node or a hierarchical management structure but is based on the principles of equality, voluntariness, reciprocity, and mutual benefit. Golff DAO consists of GTEAM and GDAO members.

GDAO members:

- Any GDAO-holding organization or individual

GTEAM (Golff DAO Contributor Team)

- A small, autonomous Golff contributor group empowered entirely by GDAO members to assist GDAO members with governance as the core facilitator of the Golff DAO
- GTEAM members include:

### Golff DAO Governance Token GDAO

GDAO as Golff’s governance token carries the function of governance of the entire Golff community and guarantees a smooth transition of Golff’s overall governance structure. GDAO is entirely derived from GOF tokens, which are equivalent to a time-weighted GOF, focusing on serving governance. Users holding GDAO will receive corresponding benefits, including.

- The right to vote on proposals in Golff governance
- Receive rewards for participating in governance
- Receive a portion of the profits of the agreement
- More benefits will be granted by community user proposals

### GDAO Output System

● In order to reduce the gas fee for users to participate in governance voting, the entire governance process will be migrated from the original Ethereum to BNB Chain for implementation. The GDAO obtained by staking GOF on the Ethereum and Heco chains can be unidirectionally cross-chained to the BNB Chain through the Golff Bridge.
● The total amount of GDAO is 10,000,000 pieces, 100% of which are generated by GOF pledge mining or lock-up mining. In the first year, 5 million pieces will be produced, on an average daily basis, and then it will be halved every year. The first year of circulation will account for 50% of the total. It is estimated that the output will be 96.88% in 5 years. At present, it has entered the halving stage of the second year, and the total output of GDAO will be 2,500,000, which will be produced by the average daily output.
● The amount of GDAO that a user can receive depends on the amount of GOF regularly pledged by the user in Golff Course (BSC&Heco) and the pledge coefficient. The calculation formula is as follows
