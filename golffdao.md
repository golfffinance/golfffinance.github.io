## Golff DAO Governance Framework

### What is a DAO?

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) A decentralized autonomous organization, sometimes called a distributed autonomous corporation (DAC, decentralized autonomous corporation), is an organization represented by rules encoded in a computer program that Everyone in a DAO can issue proposals and vote to make decisions.

### Golff DAO Governance Framework

Golff DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization and smart contract system serving the Golff ecosystem, which refers to an open decentralized organization that is not controlled by hierarchical central authority, operates automatically according to predetermined program rules, and gives voice to all stakeholders in the network.GOF is the utility token and GDAO is the governance token of the Golff system.DAO members can initiate Golff project governance proposal, and through GDAO voting jointly decide project product development, operation direction, project cooperation, machine gun pool strategy, as well as the release rules and usage of the 3.86 million GOFs yet to be released.

### Golff DAO’s Organizational Structure

Golff DAO does not have a central node or a hierarchical management structure but is based on the principles of equality, voluntariness, reciprocity, and mutual benefit. Golff DAO consists of GTEAM and GDAO members.

GDAO members:

- Any GDAO-holding organization or individual

GTEAM (Golff DAO Contributor Team)

- A small, autonomous Golff contributor group empowered entirely by GDAO members to assist GDAO members with governance as the core facilitator of the Golff DAO

### Golff DAO Governance Token GDAO

GDAO as Golff’s governance token carries the function of governance of the entire Golff community and guarantees a smooth transition of Golff’s overall governance structure. GDAO is entirely derived from GOF tokens, which are equivalent to a time-weighted GOF, focusing on serving governance. Users holding GDAO will receive corresponding benefits, including.

- The right to vote on proposals in Golff governance
- Receive rewards for participating in governance
- Receive a portion of the profits of the agreement
- More benefits will be granted by community user proposals

### GDAO Output System

According to the distribution of existing active Golff users, and in order to reduce the cost of user participation in governance, the entire governance process will be migrated from the original Ethernet to the BNB chain. The GDAO generated by the original pledged GOF will be transferred to BNB Chain through the cross-chain bridge, and the subsequent pledged GOF output GDAO will be carried out on BNB Chain.
